In this experiment I wanted to create a 3D fluid "simulation" (not a real simulation) inside of a Mesh. It will react to rotation in a realistic way.

The surface of the liquid is calculated using ray-marching.

The model used in this experiment is [Potion Bottle by Shedmon](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/potion-bottle-d69aa4d74c804a70b026c9239476d5fc). The model was edited to remove the original liquid inside, rename layers and split the bottle into two meshes.

The background HDRI is [Woods by Greg Zaal](https://polyhaven.com/a/woods).
