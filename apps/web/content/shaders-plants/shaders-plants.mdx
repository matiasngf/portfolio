In this post, I wanted to experiment with how to create procedural branches and how to make them grow along a path.

## Objectives:

This is quite a large experiment that accomplishes multiple things:

- Making a mesh "grow" along a path drawn in Blender.
- Generating new branchlets procedurally that will expand from the main branch.
- Adding leaves that will grow along with the branchlets.
- Make everything react to the scroll.

## Getting the base model

To do this experiment. I used a base [plant model from sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/free-pothos-potted-plant-money-plant-e9832f38484f4f85b3f9081b51fa3799). Once I have the model in Blender, I deleted the default branches and added some Bezier Curves that will be used as guides later.

[imagen de Blender]

To correctly export and parse the model later, the curves were transformed into geometry and renamed using the format `Branch.[number]`. I also added one leaf and stick models that will be used later in the experiment.

Finally, the model was exported as `plant.glb`.

## Main setup

I'm using `zustand` and `leva` in order to create a store and controlls that will hold the state of the plant. The store will hold the following values:

- grow: number -> The amount of growth that the plant will have.
- debugCamera: boolean -> Whether to use an external camera and helpers.
- debugGrid: boolean -> Whether to show the debug lines or not.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/utils/use-config.ts">

```ts
import { useControls } from "leva";
import { create } from "zustand";
import { shallow } from "zustand/shallow";

interface ConfigStore {
  grow: number;
  debugCamera: boolean;
  debugGrid: boolean;
}

export const useConfigStore = create<ConfigStore>(() => ({
  grow: 10,
  debugCamera: false,
  debugGrid: false,
}));

/** Should be used only once */
export const useConfigControls = () => {
  useControls(() => ({
    // disabled in prod
    grow: {
      value: 0,
      min: 0,
      max: 1.3,
      step: 0.001,
      onChange: (value) => {
        useConfigStore.setState({ grow: value });
      },
    },
    debugCamera: {
      value: false,
      onChange: (value) => {
        useConfigStore.setState({ debugCamera: value });
      },
    },
    debugGrid: {
      value: false,
      onChange: (value) => {
        useConfigStore.setState({ debugGrid: value });
      },
    },
  }));

  return;
};

export const useConfig = () => {
  return useConfigStore(
    (state) => ({
      grow: state.grow,
      debug: state.debug,
    }),
    shallow
  );
};
```

</Source>

Then, I created a main component that imports the Branches and Pot components and exports the `GLTF nodes` that will be used to parse the model.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/index.tsx">

```tsx
import { LineSegments, Mesh } from "three";
import type { GLTF } from "three-stdlib";
import { Branches } from "./branches";
import { Pot } from "./pot";

export interface PlantGLTF extends GLTF {
  nodes: {
    pot: Mesh;
    stick: Mesh;
    Branch: LineSegments;
    leaf: Mesh;
  };
}

export const Plant = () => {
  return (
    <group position={[0, 0, 0]}>
      <Branches />
      <Pot />
    </group>
  );
};
```

</Source>

I also added a background stage to the scene:

<Image src={stage} />

## Creating the main branches

To add the branches into our scene. I first needed to parse the data of the `.glb` file. Because we transformed our Bezier curves into Meshes, the data will be stored as `LineSegments`.

```tsx
import { GLTFLoader } from "three-stdlib";
import { useLoader } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { PlantGLTF } from ".";

export const Branches = () => {
  // Load the model using the GLTFLoader
  const plantModel = useLoader(
    GLTFLoader,
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/plant.glb"
  ) as unknown as PlantGLTF;

  // Parse the model and find the LineSegments nodes that start with "Branch"
  const branches = useMemo(() => {
    return Object.values(plantModel.nodes).filter(
      (node) => node.name.startsWith("Branch") && node.type === "LineSegments"
    ) as LineSegments[];
  }, [plantModel]);
};
```

Then I needed to add some uniforms that will be used by all the materials later. I also added a `useEffect` that will update the uniforms when the `grow` value changes.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useMemo } from "react";
import { Uniforms, useUniforms } from "../utils/uniforms";
import { useConfig } from "../utils/use-config";

// Create some default uniforms
const branchUniforms = {
  progress: 0,
  branchRadius: 0.005,
  branchGrowOffset: 0.1,
};

// Export the typed uniforms
export type BranchUniforms = Uniforms<typeof branchUniforms>;

export const Branches = () => {
  /** ...previous code... */

  // Add a hook to create uniforms
  const [uniforms, setUniforms] = useUniforms(branchUniforms);

  // Get the grow value from the store
  const { grow } = useConfig();

  // The grow value will be used to update the progress uniform
  useEffect(() => {
    setUniforms({
      progress: grow,
    });
  }, [grow]);
};
```

Fianlly, I mapped over the `branches` array and return a `<Branch />` component. This is the final source code:

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/branches.tsx">

```tsx
import { useLoader } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three-stdlib";
import { PlantGLTF } from ".";
import { useEffect, useMemo } from "react";
import { LineSegments } from "three";
import { Uniforms, useUniforms } from "../utils/uniforms";
import { useConfig } from "../utils/use-config";
import { Branch } from "./branch";

const branchUniforms = {
  progress: 0,
  branchRadius: 0.005,
  branchGrowOffset: 0.1,
};

export type BranchUniforms = Uniforms<typeof branchUniforms>;

export const Branches = () => {
  const plantModel = useLoader(
    GLTFLoader,
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/plant.glb"
  ) as unknown as PlantGLTF;

  const branches = useMemo(() => {
    return Object.values(plantModel.nodes).filter(
      (node) => node.name.startsWith("Branch") && node.type === "LineSegments"
    ) as LineSegments[];
  }, [plantModel]);

  const [uniforms, setUniforms] = useUniforms(branchUniforms);

  const { grow } = useConfig();

  useEffect(() => {
    setUniforms({
      progress: grow,
    });
  }, [grow]);

  return (
    <group>
      {branches.map((branch, i) => (
        <Branch uniforms={uniforms} segments={branch} key={i} branchlets={15} />
      ))}
    </group>
  );
};
```

</Source>

If we turn on the debug for the branches, we can see the path that they will follow:

<Image src={debugBranches} />

## The `<Branch/>` component

The `Branch` component will do two things. First, create a mesh that will grow along a `segments` path using the `uniforms.growFactor`, and second, add secondary procedural branches called `branchlets`.

First, lets create an interface for the component:

```ts
export interface BranchProps {
  segments: LineSegments;
  uniforms: BranchUniforms;
  branchlets: number;
}
```

Now we can start coding our component, first we can load the branch texture using the `useTexture` hook.

```tsx
export const Branch = ({ segments, uniforms, branchlets }: BranchProps) => {
  const branchMap = useTexture(
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/branch-texture.jpg",
    (t: Texture) => {
      t.wrapT = RepeatWrapping;
      t.wrapS = MirroredRepeatWrapping;
    }
  );
};
```

I wanted to generate the mesh procedurally, so I created a `getBranchMesh` function that takes the `segments` path and the `uniforms` and returns a `branchMesh` and a `branchPath`.

```tsx
export const Branch = ({ segments, uniforms, branchlets }: BranchProps) => {
  const branchMap = useTexture(
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/branch-texture.jpg",
    (t: Texture) => {
      t.wrapT = RepeatWrapping;
      t.wrapS = MirroredRepeatWrapping;
    }
  );

  const { branchMesh, branchPath } = useMemo(() => {
    return getBranchMesh(segments.clone(true), uniforms, branchMap);
  }, [segments, uniforms, branchMap]);

  return <primitive object={branchMesh} />;
};
```

_Let's go just one more step into this rabbit hole and see what the `getBranchMesh` function does._

### getBranchMesh

This function handles the generation of the branch mesh. But, this mesh needs to follow the path segments and even grow along it. To do this, I first needed to create a cylinder geometry that will be used as a base for the mesh.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/helpers/get-branch-mesh.ts">

```tsx
/** Transform a lineSegment into a branch mesh */
export const getBranchMesh = (
  branch: LineSegments,
  branchUniforms: BranchUniforms,
  texture: Texture
) => {
  const branchResolution = 20;
  const noramlizedCylinder = new CylinderGeometry(
    1, // radiusTop
    1, // radiusBottom
    1, // height
    branchResolution, // radialSegments
    numVertices * 2 // heightSegments
  );
};
```

</Source>

This is the result of the cylinder geometry:

<Image src={cylinder1} />

And these are some example vertices coordinates of the geometry:

<Image src={cylinder2} />

The idea is to reposition this cylinder vertices along the path using a shader.

<Image src={cylinderTransform1} />

Let's take one of the vertices and see how it would be transformed and call it `p`:

<Image src={cylinder3} />

We now need to find where that `vertex` would land in the `path`. To imagine this let's first stretch the path to be a straight line:

<Image src={cylinderTransform2} />

Now we can see that the `p` point would land between the second and third point of the path. Let's call those points `i` and `j`:

<Image src={cylinderTransform3} />

Knowing what vertices are `i` and `j` (previous and next vertices), we can start transforming the `p` point. The first step is to flatten all the vertices of the cylinder geometry to the `xz` plane:

<Image src={cylinderTransform4} />

Then, the point `p` will be rotated to match the direction `j-i`.

<Image src={cylinderTransform5} />

Finally, we can `lerp` between the `i` and `j` points to find the final position of `p` and translate it:

<Image src={cylinderTransform6} />

At first, I only used the raw vertex data in the branch shader, but I found that it was not very efficient. So I decided to pre-calculate some values in javascript and pass them to the shader as uniforms.

### Growing meshes

I needed a way to efficiently transform the vertices of the cylinder geometry. To do this, I created a funciton that loops over each vertex of the `segments` variable, and calculates the following variables:

```ts
// position of this point
position: Vector3;
// distance form this point to the previous one
distance: number;
// direction from this point to the next
direction: Vector3;
// rotation from the prev point to this one
rotation: Quaternion;
// rotation from the first point to this one
addedQuaternion: Quaternion;
```

Here is a visual representation of the variables:

<Image src={pathVertexVars} />

_Note: The `addedQuaternion` is calcualted by multiplying all the rotations from the previous points._

I called this interface `PathVertex`. Then I also created `PathVertices` which also has the totalDistance calculated. To do this I created the `verticesFromLineSegment` function:

```ts
interface PathVertex {
  // position of this point
  position: Vector3;
  // distance form this point to the previous one
  distance: number;
  // direction from this point to the next
  direction: Vector3;
  // rotation from the prev point to this one
  rotation: Quaternion;
  // rotation from the first point to this one
  addedQuaternion: Quaternion;
}

interface PathVertices {
  pathVertices: PathVertex[];
  totalDistance: number;
  numVertices: number;
}

const verticesFromLineSegment = (branch: LineSegments): PathVertices => {...}
```

To see the complete implementation of this function, check the source code:

## Branch material

Lets recap what we have so far:

- We are creating a function called `getBranchMesh` that handles the creation of a cylinder geometry and the transformation of the vertices.
- We have a `segments` path that will be used to generate the branch mesh.
- We precalculated the `pathVertices` that will be used to transform the vertices of the mesh.

Now we can start creating the branch shader. First, we need to create a `shaderMaterial` that will be used by the mesh:

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/helpers/get-branch-mesh.ts">

```tsx
export const getBranchMesh = (
  branch: LineSegments,
  branchUniforms: BranchUniforms,
  texture: Texture
) => {
  const branchPath = verticesFromLineSegment(branch);

  const { pathVertices, totalDistance, numVertices } = branchPath;

  /** This material will transform the cylinder geometry to follow the path */
  const branchMaterial = new ShaderMaterial({
    name: branch.name + "material",
    vertexShader: branchVertexShader,
    fragmentShader: branchFragmentShader,
    glslVersion: GLSL3,
    defines: {
      NUM_VERTICES: numVertices,
    },
    uniforms: {
      map: { value: texture },
      pathVertices: {
        value: pathVertices,
      },
      totalDistance: { value: totalDistance },
      ...branchUniforms,
    },
  });

  const branchResolution = 20;
  const noramlizedCylinder = new CylinderGeometry(
    1,
    1,
    1,
    branchResolution,
    numVertices * 2
  );
  const branchMesh = new Mesh(noramlizedCylinder, branchMaterial);

  return {
    branchMesh,
    branchPath,
    position: branch.position,
    rotation: branch.rotation,
  };
};
```

</Source>

### Vertex shader

The key of the mesh transform is on the vertex shader. First, we need to create some basic structures that will be used later:

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/utils/shaders/paths.ts">

```glsl
struct PathVertex {
  vec3 position;
  float distance;
  vec3 direction;
  // quaternion rotation
  vec4 rotation;
  vec4 addedQuaternion;
};

struct PathPos {
  vec3 position;
  vec3 direction;
  vec4 rotation;
};
```

</Source>

Now, we need to define the uniforms.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/utils/shaders/paths.ts">

```glsl
uniform PathVertex pathVertices[NUM_VERTICES];
uniform float totalDistance;
uniform float progress;
uniform float branchRadius;
uniform float branchGrowOffset;
```

</Source>

Then, some varyings that we will pass between the vertex and fragment shaders:

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/shaders/branch-shaders.ts">

```glsl
varying vec2 vUv;
varying vec3 worldPos;
varying vec3 localPos;
varying float targetFactor;
varying float growFactorRaw;
varying float growFactor; // clamped

```

</Source>

### getPositionOnPath helper

This function will calculate the position of a point on the path. It will take a `targetFactor` that will be a value between `0` and `1` and will return a `PathPos` with the position, direction, and rotation of the point.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/utils/shaders/paths.ts">

```glsl
PathPos getPositionOnPath(float percentage) {

  percentage = clamp(percentage, 0.0, 1.0);

  // Calculate the target distance along the path
  float targetDistance = percentage * totalDistance;

  // Find the index of the vertices
  // indexPrev ------> iNext
  int iNext = 1;
  float traveledDistance = pathVertices[1].distance;
  while (traveledDistance < targetDistance) {
    if (iNext == NUM_VERTICES - 1) {
      // reached the end of the path
      break;
    }
    iNext++;
    traveledDistance += pathVertices[iNext].distance;
  }
  int iPrev = max(0, iNext - 1);

  // Get the two adjacent vertices
  vec3 posPrev = pathVertices[iPrev].position;
  vec3 posNext = pathVertices[iNext].position;

  float distancePrevToNext = pathVertices[iNext].distance;

  // Calculate the interpolation factor based on distances
  // 0 ------ tDist ------ offsetDist
  float offsetDist = traveledDistance - distancePrevToNext;
  float tDist = targetDistance - offsetDist;
  float t = tDist / distancePrevToNext;

  // Interpolate the position
  vec3 position = mix(posPrev, posNext, t);

  // Calculate the direction as the normalized direction between the two vertices
  vec3 direction = mix(pathVertices[iPrev].direction, pathVertices[iNext].direction, t);

  //mix quaterions
  vec4 rotation = mix(pathVertices[iPrev].addedQuaternion, pathVertices[iNext].addedQuaternion, t);

  return PathPos(
    position,
    direction,
    rotation
  );
}
```

</Source>

### Final vertex shader

This is the complete source of the vertex shader.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/shaders/branch-shaders.ts">

```glsl
${pathStructs} // include of path structs

${pathUniforms} // include of uniforms

varying vec2 vUv;
varying vec3 worldPos;
varying vec3 localPos;
varying float targetFactor;
varying float growFactorRaw;
varying float growFactor; // clamped

${rotate} // include of some rotation helpers
${getPositionOnPath} // include of path helper

float getGrowFactor(float p) {
  float totalLenght = totalDistance * p;
  float currentLenght = localPos.y * totalLenght;
  float growEnd = totalLenght - branchGrowOffset;

  float growFactor = (growEnd - currentLenght) / branchGrowOffset + 1.;
  return growFactor;
}

void main() {
  float clampedProgress = clamp(progress, 0.0, 1.0);
  localPos = position + vec3(0.0, 0.5, 0.0);
  targetFactor = localPos.y;

  // calculate grow factor
  growFactorRaw = getGrowFactor(clampedProgress);
  growFactor = clamp(growFactorRaw, 0.0, 1.0);
  float branchSize = branchRadius * growFactor;

  // move vertices to y = 0
  vec3 targetPos = position * vec3(branchSize, 0.0, branchSize);

  //translate to path

  // rotate the Y axis to the direction
  targetPos = qtransform(pathPosition.rotation, targetPos);

  // move to pos
  targetPos += pathPosition.position;


  vUv = uv;
  worldPos = (modelMatrix * vec4(targetPos, 1.0)).xyz;
  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(targetPos, 1.0);
}
```

</Source>

Let's break down some of the operations that are happening in the shader:

<div className="-space-y-2">

```glsl
// Get position on path
PathPos pathPosition = getPositionOnPath(targetFactor * clampedProgress);
```

<Image src={cylinderTransform3} />
</div>

<div className="-space-y-2">

```glsl
// Flatten cylinder to xz plane and scale to branchSize
vec3 targetPos = position * vec3(branchSize, 0.0, branchSize);
```

<Image src={cylinderTransform4} />
</div>

<div className="-space-y-2">

```glsl
// rotate the Y axis to the direction of the
// segment where the vertex should land
targetPos = qtransform(pathPosition.rotation, targetPos);
```

<Image src={cylinderTransform5} />
</div>

<div className="-space-y-2">

```glsl
// translate
targetPos += pathPosition.position;
```

<Image src={cylinderTransform6} />
</div>

The result of this shader is a mesh that will grow along the path:

<Image src={branchPath} />

If we set the `grow` uniform to 0.5, the branch will be translated to the middle of the path:

<Image src={branchPathHalf} />

## Branchlets

Branchlets are secondary branches that will grow from the main branch. I didn't want to model each branchlet in Blender, so I decided to generate them procedurally.

<Image src={branchletsDebug} />

In order to generate the branchlet, we will need to generate a random set of points that "extends" from each branch.

Let's create a function called `getBranchletVertices` that will take a `pathVertices` array and a `t` value between `0` and `1` and will return a new set of `pathVertices` and a `position` where the branchlet will start.

The `t` value will indicate where the branchlet will start on the main branch. For example, if `t` is `0.5`, the branchlet will start in the middle of the branch. It is important to know this value for a couple of reasons:

- We want the branchlet to grow in the same "direction" of the branch to give a more natural result.
- We need to know the initial position of the branchlet to translate it to the correct position.
- We need to calculate the correct `growFactor`, we don't want the branchlet to start growing before the main branch gets to that point.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/helpers/branchlet-utils.ts">

```ts
/** Generates a branchlet that will start at the same direction/position of the branch at t */
export const getBranchletVertices = (pathVertices: PathVertex[], t: number) => {
  const branchletVertices: Vector3[] = [];

  const { direction, position } = getPathVertex(pathVertices, t);

  const currentDireciton = direction.clone();
  const currentPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
  const randomRotation = new Quaternion();

  // first vertex
  branchletVertices.push(currentPosition.clone());

  const randomFactor = 0.1;
  const numVertices = 20;
  const edgeLength = 0.01;

  for (let i = 0; i < numVertices - 1; i++) {
    // rotate direction
    randomRotation.setFromEuler(
      new Euler(
        (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 * Math.PI * randomFactor,
        (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 * Math.PI * randomFactor,
        (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 * Math.PI * randomFactor
      )
    );

    currentDireciton.applyQuaternion(randomRotation);

    // smoot Y over time
    const branchProgress = (i + 1) / numVertices;
    const growOffset = 0.7;
    const cap = 0.2;
    const yFactor =
      Math.cos(branchProgress * Math.PI * growOffset) * cap + (1 - cap);
    currentDireciton.y = currentDireciton.y * yFactor;
    currentDireciton.normalize();

    // move vertex
    currentPosition.add(currentDireciton.clone().multiplyScalar(edgeLength));

    // add vertex
    branchletVertices.push(currentPosition.clone());
  }

  return {
    pathVertices: vectorsToPathVertices(branchletVertices),
    position,
  };
};
```

</Source>

Similarly to the branch mesh, we need to create a `getBranchletMesh` function:

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/helpers/branchlet-utils">

```ts
export const getBranchletMesh = (
  path: PathVertices,
  t: number,
  uniforms: BranchUniforms,
  texture: Texture
): Mesh => {
  const branchletGeometry = new CylinderGeometry(
    1,
    1,
    1,
    10,
    path.numVertices * 2
  );
  const branchletMaterial = new ShaderMaterial({
    vertexShader: branchletVertexShader,
    fragmentShader: branchletFragmentShader,
    glslVersion: GLSL3,
    defines: {
      NUM_VERTICES: path.numVertices,
    },
    uniforms: {
      ...uniforms,
      map: { value: texture },
      pathVertices: {
        value: path.pathVertices,
      },
      tStart: { value: t + 0.1 },
      tEnd: { value: t + 0.3 },
      totalDistance: { value: path.totalDistance },
    },
  });
  const branchletMesh = new Mesh(branchletGeometry, branchletMaterial);

  return branchletMesh;
};
```

</Source>

### Branchlet material

The shader for teh branchlet material is similar to the branch material. The main difference is that we are using the `tStart` and `tEnd` uniforms to indicate where the branchlet will start and end.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/shaders/branchlet-shaders.ts">

```glsl
${pathStructs}

${pathUniforms}

uniform float tStart;
uniform float tEnd;

varying vec2 vUv;
varying vec3 worldPos;
varying vec3 localPos;
varying float targetFactor;
varying float growFactorRaw;
varying float growFactor; // clamped
varying float branchletProgress;

// add utils
${rotate}
${getPositionOnPath}
${valueRemap}

float getGrowFactor(float bProgress) {
  float branchletGrowOffset = branchGrowOffset * 0.2;
  float totalLenght = totalDistance * bProgress;

  float currentLenght = localPos.y * totalLenght;
  float growEnd = totalLenght - branchletGrowOffset;

  float growFactor = (growEnd - currentLenght) / branchletGrowOffset + 1.;
  return growFactor;
}

void main() {
  localPos = position + vec3(0.0, 0.5, 0.0);
  targetFactor = localPos.y;

  //translate to path
  branchletProgress = valueRemap(progress, tStart, tEnd, 0.0, 1.0);
  branchletProgress = clamp(branchletProgress, 0.0, 1.0);
  PathPos pathPosition = getPositionOnPath(targetFactor * branchletProgress);

  // calculate grow factor
  growFactorRaw = getGrowFactor(branchletProgress);
  growFactor = clamp(growFactorRaw, branchletProgress > 0.1 ? 0.5 : 0., 1.0);
  float branchSize = branchRadius * 0.5 * growFactor;

  // move vertices to y = 0
  vec3 targetPos = position * vec3(branchSize, 0.0, branchSize);

  // rotate the Y axis to the direction
  targetPos = qtransform(pathPosition.rotation, targetPos);

  // move to pos
  targetPos += pathPosition.position;


  vUv = uv;
  worldPos = (modelMatrix * vec4(targetPos, 1.0)).xyz;
  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(targetPos, 1.0);
}
```

Observe how the branchlets start growing after the main branch. This is achieved by using the `tStart` and `tEnd` uniforms to shift the grow factor:

### Branchlet component

Using the `getBranchletMesh` function, we can create a `<Branchlet />` component that will take the `pathVertices` and `t` values and will return a `<primitive />` component.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/branchlet.tsx">

```tsx
import { useMemo } from "react";
import {
  getBranchletMesh,
  getBranchletVertices,
} from "./helpers/branchlet-utils";
import { PathVertex } from "./helpers/path-vertex";
import { BranchUniforms } from "./branches";
import { Leaf } from "./leaf";
import { BufferGeometry, Line, LineBasicMaterial, Texture } from "three";
import { DebugLine } from "./debug-line";

interface BranchletProps {
  pathVertices: PathVertex[];
  uniforms: BranchUniforms;
  t: number;
  texture: Texture;
}

export const Branchlet = ({
  pathVertices,
  uniforms,
  t,
  texture,
}: BranchletProps) => {
  const { branchletMesh, branchletPath, position } = useMemo(() => {
    const branchletVertices = getBranchletVertices(pathVertices, t);
    const branchletMesh = getBranchletMesh(
      branchletVertices.pathVertices,
      t,
      uniforms,
      texture
    );
    return {
      branchletMesh,
      branchletPath: branchletVertices.pathVertices,
      position: branchletVertices.position,
    };
  }, [t, texture]);

  const branchletLineSegments = useMemo(() => {
    const branchletLineSegments = new Line(
      new BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(
        branchletPath.pathVertices.map((v) => v.position)
      ),

      new LineBasicMaterial({
        color: "blue",
        linewidth: 1,
        depthTest: false,
      })
    );
    return branchletLineSegments;
  }, [branchletPath]);

  return (
    <group position={position}>
      <primitive object={branchletMesh} />
    </group>
  );
};
```

</Source>

Now, we can update the `branch.tsx` file to generate an array of random numbers. Those numbers will indicate where the branchlet will grow from the main branch.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/branch.tsx">

```tsx
import {
  LineSegments,
  MirroredRepeatWrapping,
  RepeatWrapping,
  Texture,
} from "three";
import { BranchUniforms } from "./branches";
import { useMemo } from "react";
import { getBranchMesh } from "./helpers/get-branch-mesh";
import { Branchlet } from "./branchlet";
import { useTexture } from "@react-three/drei";
import { DebugLine } from "./debug-line";

export interface BranchProps {
  segments: LineSegments;
  uniforms: BranchUniforms;
  branchlets: number;
}

export const Branch = ({ segments, uniforms, branchlets }: BranchProps) => {
  const branchMap = useTexture(
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/branch-texture.jpg",
    (t: Texture) => {
      t.wrapT = RepeatWrapping;
      t.wrapS = MirroredRepeatWrapping;
    }
  );

  const { branchMesh, branchPath, position, rotation } = useMemo(() => {
    return getBranchMesh(segments.clone(true), uniforms, branchMap);
  }, [segments, uniforms, branchMap]);

  /* Generate the random points */
  const branchletsArr = useMemo(() => {
    const ts = Array.from(Array(branchlets).keys()).map(() =>
      Math.min(Math.random(), 0.9)
    );
    // add a final branchlet at the end
    ts.push(0.9);
    return ts;
  }, [branchlets]);

  return (
    <group position={position} rotation={rotation}>
      <primitive object={branchMesh} />
      {/* Map over the points*/}
      {branchletsArr.map((t, i) => (
        <Branchlet
          pathVertices={branchPath.pathVertices}
          uniforms={uniforms}
          texture={branchMap}
          t={t}
          key={i}
        />
      ))}
    </group>
  );
};
```

</Source>

## Leafs

On our plant model we have one lead geometry that we will use to create all leaves. I created a leaf node with `useMemo`.

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/leaf.tsx">

```tsx
export interface LeafProps {
  branchletPath: PathVertices;
  uniforms: BranchUniforms;
  /** Where in the main branch the branchlet starts */
  t: number;
}

export const Leaf = ({ branchletPath, uniforms, t }: LeafProps) => {
  const { debugLeaves, renderLeaves } = useConfig();

  /* Load model */
  const plantModel = useLoader(
    GLTFLoader,
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/plant.glb"
  ) as unknown as PlantGLTF;

  const [leafUniforms, setLeafUniforms] = useUniforms({
    leafProgress: 0,
  });

  const modelNode = useMemo(() => {
    const leaf = plantModel.nodes.leaf.clone();
    const leafMaterial = leaf.material as MeshStandardMaterial;
    const leafTexture = leafMaterial.map.clone();
    leafTexture.colorSpace = "srgb-linear";

    /* Create material */
    leaf.material = new ShaderMaterial({
      side: DoubleSide,
      transparent: true,
      vertexShader: leafVertexShader,
      fragmentShader: leafFragmentShader,
      glslVersion: GLSL3,
      uniforms: {
        ...leafUniforms,
        leafTexture: {
          value: leafTexture,
        },
      },
    });

    return leaf;
  }, [plantModel, branchletPath, uniforms, t]);

  const helper = useMemo(() => {
    return new AxesHelper(0.1);
  }, []);
};
```

</Source>

Then, inside a useEffect we will calculate the position and scale of the leaf based on the `growFactor`

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/leaf.tsx">

```tsx
export interface LeafProps {
  branchletPath: PathVertices;
  uniforms: BranchUniforms;
  /** Where in the main branch the branchlet starts */
  t: number;
}

export const Leaf = ({ branchletPath, uniforms, t }: LeafProps) => {
  const { debugLeaves, renderLeaves } = useConfig();

  const plantModel = useLoader(
    GLTFLoader,
    "/experiment-shaders-plants-assets/plant.glb"
  ) as unknown as PlantGLTF;

  const [leafUniforms, setLeafUniforms] = useUniforms({
    leafProgress: 0,
  });

  const modelNode = useMemo(() => {
    const leaf = plantModel.nodes.leaf.clone();
    const leafMaterial = leaf.material as MeshStandardMaterial;
    const leafTexture = leafMaterial.map.clone();
    leafTexture.colorSpace = "srgb-linear";

    leaf.material = new ShaderMaterial({
      side: DoubleSide,
      transparent: true,
      vertexShader: leafVertexShader,
      fragmentShader: leafFragmentShader,
      glslVersion: GLSL3,
      uniforms: {
        ...leafUniforms,
        leafTexture: {
          value: leafTexture,
        },
      },
    });

    return leaf;
  }, [plantModel, branchletPath, uniforms, t]);

  const helper = useMemo(() => {
    return new AxesHelper(0.1);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!modelNode) return;

    const abortController = new AbortController();
    const signal = abortController.signal;
    const isCanceled = () => signal.aborted;

    const curve = new CatmullRomCurve3(
      branchletPath.pathVertices.map((v) => v.position)
    );

    let prevProgress: number | null = null;

    const raf = () => {
      if (isCanceled()) return;
      const currentProgress = uniforms.progress.value;
      if (prevProgress === currentProgress) {
        requestAnimationFrame(raf);
        return;
      }

      const tStart = t + 0.1;
      const tEnd = t + 0.3;
      let branchletProgress = valueRemap(currentProgress, tStart, tEnd, 0, 1);
      branchletProgress = clamp(branchletProgress, 0, 1);

      // move model along branchlet path
      const point = curve.getPointAt(branchletProgress);
      const startingDirection = curve.getTangentAt(0);
      const endDirection = curve.getTangentAt(1);
      const branchDirection = startingDirection.lerp(
        endDirection,
        branchletProgress
      );
      const branchCurrentDirection = curve.getTangentAt(branchletProgress);
      branchDirection.lerp(branchCurrentDirection, 0.2);
      modelNode.position.copy(point);
      helper.position.copy(point);

      // rotate model to face branch direction
      const leafDirection = new Vector3(1, 0, 0).normalize();
      const axis = new Vector3()
        .crossVectors(leafDirection, branchDirection)
        .normalize();
      const angle = Math.acos(leafDirection.dot(branchDirection));
      modelNode.quaternion.setFromAxisAngle(axis, angle);
      helper.quaternion.setFromAxisAngle(axis, angle);

      // scale
      modelNode.scale.setScalar(branchletProgress * 2);

      // update progress
      prevProgress = currentProgress;
      setLeafUniforms({ leafProgress: branchletProgress });

      requestAnimationFrame(raf);
    };
    requestAnimationFrame(raf);

    return () => {
      abortController.abort();
    };
  }, [uniforms, branchletPath, t, modelNode]);

  return (
    <group>
      {debugLeaves && <primitive object={helper} />}
      {renderLeaves && <primitive object={modelNode} />}
    </group>
  );
};
```

</Source>

By turning on debug, we can observe how the helper follows the end of the branchlet:

<Image src={leafsDebug} />

### Leaf material

The shaders for the leaf are very simple, beacause all the position and rotation calculations are done in the `<Leaf />` component.

<Source functionName="leafVertexShader" basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/shaders/leaf-shaders.ts">

```glsl
varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
  vUv = uv;

  vec3 worldPos = (modelMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0)).xyz;
  gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);

}
```

</Source>

Here I am using the `leafTexture` and `leafProgress` (remaped `growFactor`) to color the leaf.

<Source functionName="leafFragmentShader" basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/shaders/leaf-shaders.ts">

```glsl
out vec4 fragColor;

uniform sampler2D leafTexture;
uniform float leafProgress;

varying vec2 vUv;

void main() {
  vec4 colorMap = texture2D(leafTexture, vUv).rgba;
  if (colorMap.a < 0.6) discard;

  vec3 result = colorMap.rgb;
  vec3 green = vec3(0.2, 0.5, 0.2);

  result = mix(green, result, leafProgress);

  fragColor = vec4(result, colorMap.a);
}
```

</Source>

### Adding the leaves to the scene

Finally, we can add the `<Leaf />` into the `<Branchlet />` component:

<Source basePath={experimentPath} path="/src/Plant/branchlet.tsx">

```tsx
export const Branchlet = ({
  pathVertices,
  uniforms,
  t,
  texture,
}: BranchletProps) => {
  /* ...branchlet source */

  return (
    <group position={position}>
      <primitive object={branchletMesh} />
      {/* Add the leaf component */}
      <Leaf t={t} branchletPath={branchletPath} uniforms={uniforms} />
    </group>
  );
};
```

</Source>
